ü§î What Makes This Different?
While many tools can shorten links or create QR codes, the Smart Link Manager stands out with its intelligent AI-powered correction. Most tools will simply fail if a user enters a slightly incorrect URL. This application uses Google's Gemini model to understand the user's intent and provide a corrected, functional link, saving time and reducing frustration.
